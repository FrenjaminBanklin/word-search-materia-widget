## Details ##

Review the list of terms on the right and begin searching the letter grid for each. When you identify a word or phrase from the list, click and drag from the first letter to the last letter to identify it. If the term was successfully identified, it will be crossed out from the list on the right.

When you've completed selecting all terms from the list, click the "Done" button on the bottom-right to complete the widget and receive a score.
